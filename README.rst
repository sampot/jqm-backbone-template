Simple JQM and Backbone Template Project
========================================

Most projects using JQuery mobile and Backbone frameworks together also use
`RequireJS` which is overkill for simple projects.

This template project is for those who want a simpler configuration but still need
Backbone for the application structure.

Dependencies
------------
Following libraries are used:

#. JQuery: 1.11.3
#. JQuery Mobile: 1.4.5
#. Backbone: 1.2.3
#. Lodash: 3.10.1

The project is based on Coenraets's article at http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/03/using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile/
